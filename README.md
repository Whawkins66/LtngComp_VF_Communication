# LtngComp_VF_Communication
This small project shows how to pass data between lightning component and visual force page.



NOTE : You might need to modify the field names if necessary. To maintain the ease, I have used most common fields.


1)  ContactList component bundle ->  contains component(UI) + js to show the list of contacts
2)  Visualforce page to hold the map -> ContactMap.vf
3)  Controller class (Combined for component and vf page) -> Integrator.apxc
4)  Application event component -> MapAlert.evt


I have used this in the community page. Both components are hosted on the same community page
